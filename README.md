### Key Contributions
User-Centric Design: Beginning with an in-depth analysis of user requirements, the application architecture was conceptualized and developed to cater to the distinct needs of Members, Trainers, and Admins. <br>

Database Design and Implementation: Leveraging expertise in database creation and management, a thorough Entity-Relation diagram was translated into a relational database schema using PostgreSQL. A DDL file was crafted to lay the foundation for complex data management needs. <br>

Full-Stack Development: Seamlessly integrating React for dynamic front-end and Node.js for back-end, over one thousand lines of CRUD operations were implemented using Express to support data interaction and management. <br>

Iterative UI Refinement: Grounded in user feedback, the application's UI was iteratively refined to construct visually appealing and intuitive interfaces, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

### Outcome
The resulting Health & Fitness Club web application exceeded expectations, garnering bonus marks and a grade of 110% on submission. It serves as a showcase of prowess in conceptualizing, designing, and executing feature-rich software solutions, along with a commitment to excellence in Full-Stack web development.
